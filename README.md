# Sneakers Shop - E-commerce Frontend

This project is a sample responsive e-commerce frontend web application for a sneaker shop. It demonstrates various modern web development techniques, including fetching data from an external API, rendering dynamic content, implementing UI components like carousels and accordions, and handling basic user authentication flow with client-side validation.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following main files and directories:

-   **`README.md`**: This documentation file.
-   **`index.html`**: The main landing page of the shop, showcasing banners, product categories, featured deals, popular brands, suggested products, testimonials, news, and features.
-   **`detail.html`**: The product detail page, displaying detailed information about a specific sneaker fetched dynamically.
-   **`js/`**: Directory containing JavaScript files.
    -   **`api.js`**: Handles all interactions with the external API using Axios (fetching products, getting product details, user signup/signin).
    -   **`index.js`**: Contains the JavaScript logic specific to the `index.html` page, including fetching and rendering product lists for different sections and tabs, initializing carousels (Swiper, Slick), handling product filtering, and managing the FAQ accordion.
    -   **`detail.js`**: Contains the JavaScript logic specific to the `detail.html` page, including parsing the product ID from the URL, fetching the single product's data using the API, rendering its details, and handling quantity selection and a placeholder "Add to Cart" action.
    -   **`Validate.js`**: Provides client-side form validation logic for the user login/signup modal and interacts with `api.js` for the actual authentication calls.
-   **`scss/`**: Directory containing SASS/SCSS files.
    -   **`style.scss`**: The main SCSS file that imports all partials.
    -   **`base/`**: Base styles (_reset.scss, _base.scss).
    -   **`helper/`**: Helper files (_mixin.scss, _variable.scss).
    -   **`layout/`**: Layout-specific styles (_header.scss, _footer.scss).
    -   **`components/`**: Styles for specific components (_productItem.scss, _details.scss).
-   **`css/`**: Directory containing the compiled CSS file.
    -   **`style.css`**: The final CSS file generated by compiling `scss/style.scss`. This is the file linked in the HTML.
-   **`img/`**: Directory containing project image assets.

## Technologies Used

-   **HTML5**: For structuring the web page content.
-   **CSS3 / SCSS**: For styling the application, organized using partials, variables, and mixins for maintainability. Requires compilation to CSS.
-   **JavaScript (ES6+)**: For implementing application logic, dynamic content rendering, event handling, and client-side validation.
-   **Bootstrap 5**: Utilized for responsive grid layout, basic styling components (navbar, forms, modal, tabs, cards), and utility classes.
-   **jQuery**: Used specifically by Slick Carousel for initialization and functionality.
-   **Axios**: A promise-based HTTP client used for making API requests to fetch and send data.
-   **Swiper.js**: A modern touch slider library used for the Testimonials and Latest News carousels.
-   **Slick Carousel**: A responsive carousel plugin used for the Featured Deals and product thumbnail sliders.
-   **Font Awesome**: Used for icons throughout the user interface.

## Features

The project includes the following key features:

-   **Homepage Display:** Showcases various sections like main banners, product categories, featured deals, popular brands, customer testimonials, latest news, and key store features.
-   **Dynamic Product Listing:** Displays products fetched from an external API in the "Fresh Picks For You" section, organized into tabs ("Shop All", "Men", "Women").
-   **Product Filtering:** Allows filtering of suggested products based on categories like "All Shoes", "Casuals", "Sports", "Sneakers", and "Boots".
-   **Interactive Carousels:** Implements smooth carousels for banners, featured products, testimonials, and news using Swiper.js and Slick Carousel.
-   **Product Detail View:** Clicking on a product navigates to a dedicated detail page (`detail.html`) which fetches and displays comprehensive information for that specific product, including available sizes.
-   **Quantity and Size Selection:** On the product detail page, users can select the desired size and adjust the quantity.
-   **User Authentication Modal:** Provides a modal interface for users to either log in or sign up, with client-side validation and integration with API endpoints (signup/signin data is sent).
-   **Dynamic Content Loading:** Products and details are fetched asynchronously, allowing for a more responsive user experience.
-   **FAQ Accordion:** An interactive section to answer frequently asked questions with toggleable panels.
-   **Animated Image Gallery:** A horizontally scrolling image gallery section with a hover effect.
-   **Responsive Design:** Layout and components are designed to be adaptable across various screen sizes using Bootstrap's grid and custom media queries in SCSS.
-   **Basic "Add to Cart" Simulation:** A placeholder button on the detail page logs the selected product information to the console.

## Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository https://github.com/lee-vtruong/Shoes-Sells-Project.git> {/* Replace with your repository's clone URL */}
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd sneakers-shop {/* Replace with the name of the cloned directory */}
    ```
3.  **Compile SCSS to CSS:** This step is crucial as the HTML links to the `css/style.css` file.
    *   If you use VS Code, the Live Sass Compiler extension can do this automatically. Open `scss/style.scss` and click "Watch SASS".
    *   Alternatively, use a command-line compiler (ensure Node.js and Sass are installed):
        ```bash
        sass scss/style.scss css/style.css
        # Or for continuous watching during development:
        # sass --watch scss/style.scss:css/style.css
        ```
    Ensure `css/style.css` is generated or updated.
4.  **Open `index.html` in your web browser.**

    The application should now be running locally in your browser, fetching data from the specified API and displaying the shop interface.

## Customization

-   **Styles:** Modify the SCSS partials within the `scss/` directory (e.g., `_variable.scss` for colors and spacing, `_header.scss`, `_footer.scss`, component files) to change the visual appearance. Remember to recompile SCSS after making changes.
-   **Logic:** Update the JavaScript files within `js/` (`index.js`, `detail.js`, `Validate.js`) to modify behavior, validation rules, API interactions, or add new client-side features.
-   **HTML Structure:** Adjust `index.html` and `detail.html` to modify the layout, add/remove sections, or change component arrangements.
-   **API Endpoint:** The base API URL is set in `js/api.js`. You can modify this if you are using a different backend source.

## API Used

This project utilizes the following external API endpoint for product data and basic user authentication:

-   **Base URL:** `https://shop.cyberlearn.vn`

Specific endpoints used include:
-   `/api/Product` (GET - Get all products)
-   `/api/Product/getbyid` (GET - Get product details by ID)
-   `/api/Users/signup` (POST - User registration)
-   `/api/Users/signin` (POST - User login)
